Liquid Stack keeps the Waline comment component, while its example URL is not connected to a real backend.

## Prepare a server

Deploy your own service by following the official Waline documentation. When you have its URL, replace the sample value at `params.comments.waline.serverURL` in `hugo.yaml`.

## Enable or disable comments

Set `params.comments.enabled` to `true` to enable comments. Individual posts can still use `comments: false`, which is useful for privacy pages, documentation, or announcements.

## Optional secure uploads and verification

`params.comments.waline.secureUploads` is disabled by default. It is an integration example for a Waline-compatible backend that provides `/api/upload-session`, `/api/upload-image`, `/api/comment-context`, and a comment endpoint accepting a Turnstile token. Add your public Cloudflare Turnstile site key, implement the matching server-side verification and limits, then enable the option. The browser validates JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF files up to 3 MB, but the server must repeat every validation and enforce origin, rate, session, and storage limits.

Never put the Turnstile secret key or storage credentials in Hugo configuration. The theme only contains public frontend configuration; see `docs/waline-secure-uploads.md` for the endpoint contract.

## Test before release

Check that the comment box appears below a post locally, then test submission, moderation, and notifications after deployment. Keep server URLs, tokens, and administrator settings in your own environment rather than in a public theme example.
